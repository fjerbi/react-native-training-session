# react-native-training-session
Training session with using react-native to develop a movies displaying applications using TMDB api.

I'm working with react-native-web since I have a very slow computer and can't render the app on an emulator,
but it is the same architecture, nothing changes.


:heavy_check_mark: Estimated application finishing: 5 hours of straight coding + 2 hours for optimization and refactoring
